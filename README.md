Quick Reference
📘 What is SOLID?
SOLID is a set of five software design principles that help create flexible, scalable, and maintainable systems.

Single Responsibility
Open/Closed
Liskov Substitution
Interface Segregation
Dependency Inversion
💡 Think of SOLID as a toolbox of principles for writing clean code, not strict rules.

🎯 Why SOLID?
✅ Makes code easier to understand and maintain
✅ Encourages clear separation of concerns
✅ Improves testability of components
✅ Reduces bugs and regressions when making changes

⚠️ Overuse can lead to unnecessary abstraction. Balance is key.

🏛 Principles
S — Single Responsibility Principle
“A class should have only one reason to change.”

Avoid classes that mix unrelated responsibilities (e.g., validation + persistence + logging).
Keeps each unit small, focused, and easier to test.
If you can’t summarize a class in one short sentence → it probably violates SRP.
O — Open/Closed Principle
“Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.”

You should add new features by adding new code, not rewriting old code.
Use extension points (e.g., strategies, plug-ins) instead of modifying core logic.
Prevents introducing bugs when extending functionality.
L — Liskov Substitution Principle
“Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.”

A derived class should never break expectations of its base class.
Avoid child classes that disable or throw errors for base functionality.
Promotes reliable polymorphism and safer inheritance.
I — Interface Segregation Principle
“No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.”

Prefer small, role-specific interfaces over large, bloated ones.
Prevents empty or unused implementations in classes.
Makes systems easier to extend and maintain.
D — Dependency Inversion Principle
“High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.”

Business logic should depend on interfaces/abstractions, not concrete classes.
In practice: use Dependency Injection (DI).
Promotes testability, flexibility, and loose coupling.
🚀 How to apply SOLID in real projects
Spot “god classes” — split them by responsibility.
Introduce abstractions where business logic depends on infrastructure.
Use Dependency Injection (ASP.NET Core provides this by default).
Replace long if/switch chains with polymorphism (strategy, state, specification).
Write tests first before refactoring to ensure behavior remains consistent.
📝 Quick Reference
S → One reason to change
O → Extend, don’t modify
L → Subtypes must not break expectations
I → Many small interfaces > one large one
D → Depend on abstractions, not concretions
