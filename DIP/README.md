# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) – README

---

## 📘 What is DIP?
The **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** states that:  
**“High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.”**  
**“Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.”**

In short, design systems where policies and details are separated, and dependencies flow towards **abstractions (interfaces/contracts)**, not concrete implementations.

---

## 🎯 Why DIP?
✅ Promotes loose coupling between components  
✅ Makes systems easier to extend and modify  
✅ Encourages dependency injection and clean architecture  
✅ Prevents high-level business logic from being tied to technical details  

---

## 🔎 Signs of DIP Violations
- High-level logic directly creates or manages low-level components.  
- Business rules break whenever implementation details change.  
- Hardcoded dependencies that cannot be swapped out.  
- Difficulty writing unit tests because modules are tightly coupled.  

---

## 🛠 Benefits of Applying DIP
- **Flexibility** → Swap implementations without changing high-level code.  
- **Testability** → Mock or fake dependencies easily.  
- **Maintainability** → Isolate changes in low-level details (e.g., database, frameworks).  
- **Scalability** → High-level policies remain stable even as implementations evolve.  

---

## 🚀 How to Apply DIP
1. **Define abstractions** → Use interfaces or abstract contracts for dependencies.  
2. **Depend on abstractions** → High-level modules should interact only with contracts.  
3. **Use dependency injection** → Provide implementations from the outside (constructor, method, or property injection).  
4. **Separate policies from details** → Keep core business logic independent of frameworks, databases, or external services.

## 💡 Summary
The Dependency Inversion Principle ensures that **business logic depends on stable abstractions rather than volatile details**.  
When in doubt, ask yourself:  
👉 *“If I replace this low-level detail (database, logger, API), will the high-level code remain unchanged?”*  
If no → it violates DIP.
